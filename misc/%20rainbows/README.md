## Solution
* Use hex of blocks of color to create ascii text

```
This is meant as an easy challenge.

Untitled.png contains an image where each color is made of 3 hex characters.

Opening this file in a hex editor may reveal to challengers the word "who", which may hint that it contains text.

In addition, there are many hex "20s" and the challenge is named "%20rainbows", which may indicate that it contains the space character (from url encoding).

Even further, these colors all fit a specific theme that may be recognizable to some outright as text encoding colors.

Reading 3 hex characters at a time, the sentence reads:

who knew you could encode text as an image? did you open this as a png, or just convert it jctf{from hex?}  

Flag: jctf{from hex?}
