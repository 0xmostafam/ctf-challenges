## Solution
Check the UV Map of the .fbx file

```
a 3d model where the UV map (the mapping for textures onto the polygons) contains the flag

there is no texture assigned to the model, but it isn't needed to find the flag. assigning one may help reveal the UVs, however

without any 3d modeling experience this becomes an out of the box steg problem

the model is from a freely available blender splash screen. https://cloud.blender.org/p/gallery/60337d495677e942564cce76

flag: jctf{gETfLooR}
```
