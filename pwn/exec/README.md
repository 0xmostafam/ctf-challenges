# exec
* Run the executable

## Solution
* Be sure to be running a 64 bit architecture and on a Linux Distro
`./exec` should work if you are in the same directory as exec executable

* The `rand-obfusc.py` is needed to make sure that the utility `strings` won't break this challenge (and somewhat makes it more difficult)
    * Run for some C Code generation
